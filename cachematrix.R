## This code snippet is to find the inverse of a Matrix


## this function is used to define the entered matrix into makeCacheMatrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function inverts the matrix and stores it in the cacheSolve

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
